    <h1>üö® My First Real Alert Triage in a CSOC</h1>
    <p class="date">Posted: July 2025</p>

    <p>In my first month as a SOC Analyst, I was assigned to monitor PowerShell behavior using Splunk. One alert stood out: an encoded PowerShell command being executed under a user session with admin privileges. It was flagged by a correlation rule based on MITRE ATT&CK T1059.001.</p>

    <h3>üîç Detection</h3>
    <p>I used Splunk to inspect the raw event and then reviewed the process tree using endpoint logs. The parent process was Outlook, followed by a suspicious child PowerShell process. This raised red flags immediately.</p>

    <h3>üö¶ Triage Strategy</h3>
    <p>I pivoted through similar historical events and identified a pattern ‚Äî the same user account had executed macros a few hours earlier. It looked like a phishing payload had succeeded. I quickly escalated it to IR.</p>

    <h3>‚úÖ Outcome</h3>
    <p>The IR team confirmed it was a malicious payload. As a result, the account was disabled, and endpoint isolation was triggered via our EDR. It was my first time catching and escalating something critical ‚Äî a moment I won‚Äôt forget.</p>
